# St-Dennis-Electronic-Forms-Sign-Off
This is the README file for my individual project for Fall 2016 Enterprise Java.

Problem Statement: 
St Dennis School needs a more efficient method for getting and tracking parent sign off on forms so that they can save costs on printing and more accurately track sign off.

User Stories:
As an administrator, I want to be able to see all parents who have not signed off on forms for their child so that I can remind them to do that.

As an administrator, I want teachers to be able to see all parents in their class who have not signed off on forms for their child so that the teacher can remind them to do that.

As a parent, I want to view the forms I need to sign off for online so that I don't have to keep track of a paper copy.

As a parent, I want to e-sign forms so that I don't have to print a copy and hand it in to the school.

As a parent, I only want to see forms I still need to sign so that I don't have to scroll through and track which forms I still need to sign off on by myself.

As a parent, I want to be able to see all of my children's forms if I have more than one child, so that I don't have to login for each child.
